<p>I have a great passion in Food Security and Rural Development give my background in Range Management. Farming is also therapeutic to me. 
    I believe Africa will attain its glory through Agriculture as its underutilized. My vision is to cover stories on Agriculture across the continent that will change the perspectives about Agriculture.</p>

<h3>WHY FARM WITH BISASE</h3>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">
<p>So why FARM WITH BISASE?
 Have always had an interest in agriculture since I was young but it grew into a passion when I joined University of Nairobi, College of Agriculture and Veterinary medicine (CAVS) AKA Kabete Ngombe..lool.
<br>
<div></div>
 Upon graduating I started my career in totally different sector, Customer Operations. The first few months were unfulfilling but I thank God I got 2 colleagues who also had an interest in agriculture and in 2020 we did Irish and as they say the rest is history
<br>

<br>
 We are still learning we hope to hopefully grow to large scale farming.
 I also hope to cover successful farming ventures so that we learn together.
